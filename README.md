This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to the IsEmpty function and Variant data types.  The `bug.vbs` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version.  The issue stems from how VBScript handles Variant variables that are not initialized or are assigned Null values.  The IsEmpty function might behave inconsistently in these cases, leading to unexpected program behavior. This example highlights the importance of explicitly handling Null and uninitialized Variant variables to avoid unexpected behavior.
